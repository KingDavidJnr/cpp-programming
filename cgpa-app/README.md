# CGPA Calculator

This C++ code helps students calculate their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) based on a 5.0 or 4.0 grading system.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to compile and run the code on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the code, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. For example, you can use GCC or Clang.

### Compiling the Code

1. Download the `cgpa_calculator.cpp` file from this repository.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the `cgpa_calculator.cpp` file.

3. Compile the code using the following command:

   ```bash
   g++ -o cgpa_calculator cgpa_calculator.cpp
   ```

   This command will create an executable file named `cgpa_calculator`.

### Running the Code

1. After successfully compiling the code, run the executable by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   ./cgpa_calculator
   ```

2. The program will prompt you to enter the number of courses and the grades for each course. Follow the on-screen instructions and provide the required inputs.

3. Next, the program will ask whether the grading system is on a 5.0 scale. Enter `1` if it is, and `0` if it is not.

4. After entering the necessary information, the program will calculate and display your CGPA.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the program's interaction might look during usage:

```
Enter the number of courses: 4
Enter the grades for each course:
Course 1 grade: 4.0
Course 2 grade: 4.0
Course 3 grade: 3.7
Course 4 grade: 3.5
Is the grading system on a 5.0 scale? (1 for yes, 0 for no): 0
Your CGPA is: 3.75
```

In this example, the user entered grades for four courses, specified that the grading system is not on a 5.0 scale, and the program calculated the CGPA as 3.75.
