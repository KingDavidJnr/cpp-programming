# Heap Data Structure

The Heap data structure is a complete binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It is commonly used in various algorithms and applications, such as priority queues and sorting algorithms. A heap allows efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the maximum (or minimum) element.

## Overview

A heap is a binary tree-like data structure where each node satisfies the heap property. The heap property differs depending on whether it is a max heap or a min heap. In a max heap, for any given node, the value of the parent node is greater than or equal to the values of its children nodes. Conversely, in a min heap, the value of the parent node is smaller than or equal to the values of its children nodes.

Heaps are typically implemented using arrays or vectors due to their efficient memory utilization. The structure of the heap is maintained by satisfying two main properties:

1. **Complete Binary Tree Property**: A heap is a complete binary tree, meaning all levels of the tree are fully filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.

2. **Heap Property**: In a max heap, for every node `i` (except the root), the value at `i` is greater than or equal to the values at its children. In a min heap, the value at `i` is smaller than or equal to the values at its children.

## Operations and Complexity

The Heap data structure supports the following operations:

- **Insertion**: Adding a new element to the heap. This operation ensures that the heap property is maintained. The complexity of insertion is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the heap.

- **Extraction of Maximum (or Minimum)**: Removing and returning the maximum (or minimum) element from the heap. This operation also reorganizes the heap to maintain the heap property. The complexity of extraction is O(log n).

- **Removal**: Removing an element at a specific index from the heap. This operation involves replacing the element with a new value and then reorganizing the heap. The complexity of removal is O(log n).

- **Peek**: Accessing the maximum (or minimum) element without removing it from the heap. This operation has a complexity of O(1).

Heaps are widely used in various algorithms and applications, including:

- **Priority Queues**: Heaps can efficiently implement priority queues, where elements are stored with associated priority values and can be retrieved based on their priority.

- **Heap Sort**: Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that utilizes the heap data structure to sort elements in ascending or descending order.

- **Graph Algorithms**: Heaps are used in various graph algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph and Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree.

## Conclusion

The Heap data structure provides an efficient way to maintain a partially ordered binary tree. With its ability to quickly access the maximum (or minimum) element and efficient insertion and removal operations, heaps are a fundamental data structure used in a variety of algorithms and applications. Understanding the heap data structure is essential for solving many algorithmic problems efficiently.
